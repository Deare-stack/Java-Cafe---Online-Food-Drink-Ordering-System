The project uses Express.js for the backend, supporting CRUD operations for user accounts, orders, and product listings. The database is built with MySQL to manage user information, orders, and product categories efficiently.

This project serves as both a practical application for learning full-stack development and a functional prototype for a real-world cafe business.
