- Project Overview:
Java Cafe is an online food and drink ordering platform that provides a seamless user experience for browsing and ordering cafe products. The application is built using Express.js for the backend, allowing for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user accounts, orders, and product listings. The database is powered by MySQL, efficiently managing user information, order details, and product categories.

- Key Features:
1. User Account Management: Users can create, update, and delete accounts.
2. Menu Browsing: Customers can browse available products and view item details.
3. Order Management: Users can place orders, modify cart contents, and checkout securely.
4. Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
- Purpose:
This project serves as both a practical application for learning full-stack web development and as a functional prototype for a real-world cafe business. It combines the use of modern web technologies and databases to deliver an intuitive and scalable solution for an online cafe ordering system.
